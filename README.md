I'm a Computer Science major with Cognitive Science minor at Swarthmore College, graduating in May, 2025.

I am interested in the following:
- Full-stack (Frontend or Backend) development
- iOS/Android development
- Fintech
- ML/AI

I intend to use natural language processing to identify knowledge implicit in large collections of text and apply this knowledge to build innovative applications. This way, I want to finesse human-computer interactions and create a proper understanding between machines and humans.
