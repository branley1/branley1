- Hi, Iâ€™m Branley Mmasi. I am a rising junior at Swarthmore College, graduating in May 2025. 
- As a prospective Computer Science major with a minor in Cognitive Science. My interests are broadly in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics. I intend to use natural language processing to identify knowledge implicit in large collections of text and apply this knowledge to build innovative applications. This way, I want to finesse human-computer interactions and create a proper understanding between machines and humans.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m really looking forward to taking Machine Learning and Algorithms classes this Fall (2023).
-  I have completed coursework on Data Structures and Algorithms (C++), iOS (Swift) and Android (React Native) Mobile App Development, Introduction to Computer Systems (C), Python etc.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on iOS Development projects, mobile app development on Android and backend development in Python and/or C++.
