- 👋 Hi, I’m Branley Mmasi
- 👀 My interests are broadly in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics. I intend to use natural language processing to identify knowledge implicit in large collections of text and apply this knowledge to build innovative applications. This way, I want to finesse human-computer interactions and create a proper understanding between machines and humans. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms, iOS and Android Mobile App Development this spring (2022).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on iOS Development projects, mobile app development on Android and backend development in Python and/or C++.
- 📫 How to reach me: mmasi.branley@gmail.com
