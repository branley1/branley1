I'm a rising senior at Swarthmore College, and a SWE intern at Google. As a Computer Science major and Cognitive Science minor, my interests are broadly in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics. 

I intend to use natural language processing to identify knowledge implicit in large collections of text and apply this knowledge to build innovative applications. This way, I want to finesse human-computer interactions and create a proper understanding between machines and humans.
