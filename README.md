- Hi, Iâ€™m Branley Mmasi. I am a current sophomore, graduating in May 2025. I have a strong educational background in Computer Science and Mathematics, and am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s of Arts in Computer Science and double major in Mathematics at Swarthmore College.
- My interests are broadly in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics. I intend to use natural language processing to identify knowledge implicit in large collections of text and apply this knowledge to build innovative applications. This way, I want to finesse human-computer interactions and create a proper understanding between machines and humans. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking forward to learning Machine Learning and Algorithms this Spring(2023).
-  I have completed coursework on Data Structures and Algorithms (C++), iOS (Swift) and Android (React Native) Mobile App Development, Introduction to Computer Systems (C), Python etc.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on iOS Development projects, mobile app development on Android and backend development in Python and/or C++.
